# Escalator

## 1.0  Introduction

An escalator is a moving staircase which carries people between floors of a building or structure. 
It consists of a motor-driven chain of individually linked steps on a track which cycle on a pair of tracks which keep them horizontal.

Escalators are often used around the world in places where lifts would be impractical, or they can be used in conjunction with them.
 Principal areas of usage include department stores, shopping malls, airports, transit systems (railway/railroad stations), convention centers, hotels, arenas, stadiums and public buildings.

Escalators have the capacity to move large numbers of people. 
They have no waiting interval (except during very heavy traffic). 
They can be used to guide people toward main exits or special exhibits and may be weatherproofed for outdoor use.
 A non-functional escalator can function as a normal staircase, whereas many other methods of transport become useless when they break down or lose power.

### Landing platforms
    These contain the curved sections of the tracks, in addition to the gears and motors.
    The floor plate provides space for users to stand before stepping onto the moving steps.
    The comb plate has a series of cleats (like the teeth of a comb),
    that mesh with matching cleats on the edges of the steps and minimise the gap between the stair and the landing.


### Truss
    The structure that bridges the lower and upper landings, and carries the straight track sections.
    Steel or concrete supports connect the ends of the truss to the top and bottom landing platforms.

### Balustrade
    This is the structure supporting the handrail of the escalator and can be made of metal, sandwich panels or glass.

### Handrail
    The handrail moves courtesy of a chain connected to the main drive gear by a series of pulleys. 
    It is generally made from a blend of synthetic polymers and rubber, and is designed to be very durable.

### Tracks
    The step-wheel track for the front wheels of the steps, and the trailer-wheel track for the back wheels of the steps,
    cause the steps to form a staircase as they move from under the comb plate.

### Steps
    These are typically solid and made of die-cast aluminium or steel. 
    They are cleated with comb-like protrusions that mesh with the comb plates.
    The steps are linked by a continuous metal chain that forms a closed loop.
    The steps, connected in series, always step level as they move. 
    The steps create a flat platform at both the top and the bottom of the escalator by collapsing on each other.
    This works by way of the two sets of wheels on each step. 
    The upper set of wheels are connected to the rotating chains, pulled by the gears at the top of the escalator. 
    The lower set of wheels follow behind and just glide along on their track.

### Motor
    Escalators are driven by a motor and chain system inside the truss. 
    At its core are a pair of chains looped around two pairs of gears.
    The gears at the top of the escalator are turned by an electric motor, which in turn rotates the chain loops.
    The electric motor also powers the moving handrail which is looped around a series of wheels and is configured
    so that it moves at a similar speed to the steps.

## WHY - 
    - It carries people between floors of a building or structure.
    - Can be more practical than lifts.

## WHAT -
    - Staircase.
	  - A variation of the escalator is the moving walkway, which transports people horizontally.


## WHERE -
    - Malls, Buildings,Theatres etc

## WHEN -
    - To carry people between floors of a building

## WHO - 
    - Escalators are commonly used in buildings where the movement of a large number of people is required, 
	  - such as shopping centres, airports, transit systems, exhibition halls, hotels, arenas, public buildings, and so on.


## HOW - 
    - By sesnsing the object present and running the DC motor


# SWOT Analysis : 

## STRENGTH -
	 - Automatic 
	 - Power saving
	
## WEAKNESS - 
	- Sensor Fail
	- Motor fail

## OPPORTUNITIES - 
	- Advanced Technology
	- Urbanisation

## THREATS - 
	- Sensor and Motor may fail 
	
		

# Advantages :
	- Automatic
	- Power save
	- Easy Living
	- They occupy the same physical space as a staircase
	- Generally have no waiting time
	- Allow a greater flow of people, 
	- can be more practical than lifts. It is also possible for people to walk up or down escalators, if they are in a hurry, or if they break down.


	
# Applications :
	- Shopping centres
	- Airports
	- Transit systems
	- Exhibition halls
	- Hotels
 	- Arenas
	- Public buildings, and so on.
