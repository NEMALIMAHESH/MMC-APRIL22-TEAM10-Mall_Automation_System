# Introduction
* It measures the temperature and humidity of air. If temperature is high it will glow red led. If temperature is normal it will green led. if temperature is low it will glow blue led.
## Components used
* Stm32f407
* Temperature and humidity sensor.
* Breadboard
* Connecting Wires
* Resistors
## SWOT ANALYSIS:

* Weakness:
  * Failure of Sensors
  * In case of low power
* Opurtunities:
  * Increase in growth day by day
* Threats:
  * Failure of System.
## 5W'S and 1H:
### WHY:
* It can be used to measure the temperature automatically using DHT11 sensor.
### WHAT:
*  It measures the temperature and humidity of air. If temperature is high it will glow red led. If temperature is normal it will green led. if temperature is low it will glow blue led
